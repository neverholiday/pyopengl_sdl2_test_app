#   GOAL
#   this is simple code for sdl2 and pyopengl to render.
#   I'll keep this repo as a template for doing other thing on my project.
#   If there are anything need to improve such as handle sdl2 event, own math library (base on numpy). I'll update this repos
#   So, keep this repos as simple as possible.
